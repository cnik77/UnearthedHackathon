Barrick Gold and Unearthed hosted a Data Science Hackathon in Denver. The challenge is to develop an image classification system that could 
differentiate copper ore from waster rocks. As processing waste unnecessarily is a cash flow negative exercise, this could potentially 
save multi million dollars per year.

We won "People's Choice Award" for the classification system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). I could not include the 
image data used to build the classifier as it is private data owned by Barrick Gold Corporation.
